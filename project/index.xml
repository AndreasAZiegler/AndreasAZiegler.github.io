&lt;p>In exploration, the goal is to build a map of an unknown environment. Most state-of-the-art approaches use map representations that require drift-free state estimates to function properly. Real-world state estimators, however, exhibit drift. In this paper, we present a 2D map representation for exploration that is robust to drift. Rather than a global map, it uses local metric volumes connected by relative pose estimates. This pose-graph does not need to be globally consistent. Overlaps between the volumes are resolved locally, rather than on the faulty estimate of space. We demonstrate our representation with a frontier-based exploration approach, evaluate it under different conditions and compare it with a commonly-used grid-based representation. We show that, at the cost of longer exploration time, using the proposed representation allows full coverage of space even for very large drift in the state estimate, contrary to the grid-based representation. The system is validated in a real world experiment and we discuss its extension to 3D.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>A Representation for Exploration that is Robust to State Estimate Drift</title><link>https://andreasaziegler.github.io/project/exploration/</link><pubDate>Mon, 30 Apr 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://andreasaziegler.github.io/project/exploration/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="motivation">Motivation&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Exploration is a fundamental task in the field of robotics. The goal is to build a map of a previously unknown environment. Two tasks have to be performed repeatedly for exploration: mapping the space the robot so far perceived; and planning where to go next. In this thesis we focus on the first task and the goal is to find a map representation that can deal with noisy state estimates. All so far presented map representations either assume perfect state estimates or need to rebuild the map after optimization.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="approach">Approach&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>To achieve this goal we build our representation with polygons. Our polygons represent the boundary between free known space and occupied space or unknown space and the inside of polygons is implicitly free space. We develop two approaches: The first approach builds a global map with polygons by continuously building the union of the polygon from the current field of view and the polygons of the so far explored space. The second approach works with polygons of the local field of view only. For every local polygon the frontiers, the obstacles and the free space is determined and the robot explores as long frontiers are present in the map.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="result">Result&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>In this thesis we propose a novel representation that can deal with noisy state estimates and does not need to rebuild the map or parts of it, e.g. after a loop closure. By experiments we show that we achieve full coverage of the area to explore with frontier-based exploration, using our proposed representation.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Map Fusion for Collaborative UAV SLAM</title><link>https://andreasaziegler.github.io/project/map-fusion/</link><pubDate>Thu, 30 Mar 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://andreasaziegler.github.io/project/map-fusion/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="motivation">Motivation&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>A correct and accurate common map is crucial for multiple robots to collaboratively performing tasks. In this semester project, an existing multi agent Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping (SLAM) system should be extended to fuse maps of single robots in a way that no false map alignment is guaranteed and that an optimal alignment is achieved by using multiple place matches. Also redundant information, a consequence of the fusion of two maps, should be removed in order to get a good performance of the optimization routines e.g. Bundle Adjustment (BA).&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="approach">Approach&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>To achieve the first goal, a new approach is proposed which uses multiple KeyFrame Matchs (KFMs) to fuse two maps. This proposed approach also use a novel idea to spread the KFMs over a bigger area by skipping KeyFrames (KFs) between the detection of KFMs. To remove redundant information, KF culling is performed after all KFMs were detected and before the main map fusion. This way information which were present in both maps appear only once in the fused map and the Pose Graph Optimization (PGO) and the BA does not have unnecessary data to process. To reduce the runtime of the optimization part (PGO and BA), the usage of Powell’s dog leg (DL) non-linear least squares technique instead of the Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) optimization was evaluated and the system was adapted in a way, that the performance is increased.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="result">Result&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The proposed map fusion approach reduces drift and achieves better accuracy compared to the previous approach. With the implemented KF culling, the number of KFs which the PGO and the BA have to process is decreased significantly and therefore better timing is achieved. The usage of DL non-linear least squares technique reduced the runtime of the optimization furthermore.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Robust object tracking in 3D by fusing ultra-wideband and vision</title><link>https://andreasaziegler.github.io/project/object-tracking/</link><pubDate>Wed, 02 Nov 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://andreasaziegler.github.io/project/object-tracking/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="motivation">Motivation&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Object tracking is an important part for many applications especially for robotic systems interacting with humans. Problem statement Ultra-wideband (UWB) systems as well as vision based object trackers are widely known and used. Both of the systems have their advantages and disadvantages. UWB systems can provide the location of an object in 3D with an accuracy of approximate 10cm whereas vision based object trackers can only provide the location of an object in 2D pixel coordinates but with a more precise accuracy than UWB systems.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="approach">Approach&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>So why not combine these two sources of information? Exactly this concept should be developed and evaluated in this semester project. The 3D position measured by the UWB system should be fused with the 2D pixel coordinates of a visual object tracker with an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF). A re-detection mechanism for the visual tracker should be implemented in addition to increase the usability as well as the stability of the system.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="result">Result&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The proposed system shows a significantly better accuracy compared with the 3D positions measured by the UWB system. This proof of concept enables to apply this system to a wide range of applications and also allows further extensions.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
