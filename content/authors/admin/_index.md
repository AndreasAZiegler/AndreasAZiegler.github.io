I am a PhD candidate at the [Cognitive Systems Group](https://uni-tuebingen.de/en/118829) at the [University of Tübingen](https://uni-tuebingen.de/) in collaboration with [Sony AI](https://ai.sony/) working on event-based vision for fast robot control. During my PhD, I did an internship at [Prophesee](https://www.prophesee.ai), supervised by [Dr. Amos Sironi](https://fr.linkedin.com/in/amos-sironi/en) and at [Sony AI](https://ai.sony/), supervised by [Dr. Raphaela Kreiser](https://ai.sony/people/Raphaela-Kreiser/) and [Dr. Naoya Takahashi](https://ai.sony/people/Naoya-Takahashi/).

I am passioned about a mix of robotics and computer vision research and industrial/commercial applications. My vision is to develop novel algorithms and make them work on real robots.

Before I started my PhD studies, I worked as a Robotics Engineer for a few years. Previously, I was a Research Assistant at the [Robotics and Perception Group](http://rpg.ifi.uzh.ch/) continuing the project of my Master thesis. Before that, I was a Research Associate Intern at [Disney Research Zurich](https://www.disneyresearch.com/). I have done my Master thesis at the [Robotics and Perception Group](http://rpg.ifi.uzh.ch/), was a Computer Vision & Robotics intern at [Pix4D](https://www.pix4d.com/) while I was a master student at [D-ITET](https://www.ee.ethz.ch/) at [ETH Zurich](https://www.ethz.ch/) focusing on Computer Vision, Robotics and Machine Learning. Before my master studies, I worked at the [Research in Orthopedic Computer Science (ROCS)](https://rocs.balgrist.ch/) and at the [Institute of Biomechanics](http://www.biomechanics.ch/) after I completed my BSc in Electrical Engineering at the [University of Applied Sciences of Eastern Switzerland (FHO)](https://www.hsr.ch/).
