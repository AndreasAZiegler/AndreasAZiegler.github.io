## Description

Event cameras are bio-inspired sensors that differ from conventional frame cameras: Instead of capturing images at a fixed rate, they asynchronously measure per-pixel brightness changes, and output a stream of events that encode the time, location and sign of the brightness changes. Event cameras offer attractive properties compared to traditional cameras: high temporal resolution (in the order of Î¼s), very high dynamic range (140 dB vs. 60 dB), low power consumption, and high pixel bandwidth (on the order of kHz) resulting in reduced motion blur. Hence, event cameras have a large potential for robotics and computer vision.

So far, most learning approaches applied to event data, convert a batch of events into a tensor and then use conventional CNNs as network. While such approaches achieve state-of-the-art performance, they do not make use of the asynchronous nature of the event data. Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) on the other hand are bio-inspired networks that can process output from event-based directly. SNNs process information conveyed as temporal spikes rather than numeric values. This makes SNNs an ideal counterpart for event-based cameras.

The goal of this thesis is to investigate and evaluate how a SNN can be used together with our event-based cameras to detect and track table tennis balls. The Cognitive Systems groups has a table tennis robot system, where the developed ball tracker can be used and compared to other methods.
