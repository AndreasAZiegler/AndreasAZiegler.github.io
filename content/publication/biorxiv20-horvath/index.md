Abstract: Here, a dynamic traction force microscopy method is described which enables sub-second temporal resolution imaging of transient subcellular events secondary to extrinsic stretch of adherent single cells. The system employs a novel tracking approach with minimal computational overhead to compensate substrate-based stretch-induced motion/drift of stretched single cells in real time, allowing capture of biophysical phenomena on multiple channels by fluorescent multichannel imaging on a single camera, thus avoiding the need for beam splitting with associated loss of light. The potential impact of the technique is demonstrated by characterizing transient subcellular forces and corresponding nuclear deformations in equibiaxial stretching experiments, uncovering a high frequency strain-rate dependent response in the transfer of substrate strains to the nucleus.
