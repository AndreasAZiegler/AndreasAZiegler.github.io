abstract: Table tennis is a fast-paced and exhilarating sport that demands agility, precision, and fast reflexes. In recent years, robotic table tennis has become a popular research challenge for robot perception algorithms. Fast and accurate ball detection is crucial for enabling a robotic arm to rally the ball back successfully. Previous approaches have employed conventional frame-based cameras with CNN or traditional computer vision methods. In this paper, we propose a novel solution that combines an event-based camera with Spiking Neural Network (SNN) for ball detection. We use multiple state-of-the-art SNN frameworks and develop a SNN architecture for each of them, complying with their corresponding limitations. Additionally, we implement the SNN solution across multiple neuromorphic edge devices, conducting comparisons of their accuracies and run-times. This furnishes robotics researchers with a benchmark illustrating the capabilities achievable with each SNN framework and a corresponding neuromorphic edge device. Next to this comparison of SNN solutions for robots, we also show that an SNN on a neuromorphic edge device is able to run in real-time in a closed loop robotic system, a table tennis robot in our use case.
